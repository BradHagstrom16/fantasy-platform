"""
Golf Pick 'Em — Tournament Reminder & Notification Module
===========================================================

Handles two types of emails:
1. "Picks Are Open" - Sent when field is synced (called from services/sync.py)
2. Deadline Reminders - Sent at 24h, 12h, 1h before deadline

Reminder Schedule:
  - 24 hours before deadline
  - 12 hours before deadline
  - 1 hour before deadline (FINAL)

IMPORTANT: Reminders are ONLY sent if the field is synced (>=50 players).
           If field is not ready, no reminders go out.

All functions run inside the existing Flask app context — do NOT wrap in
app.app_context(). They are called from CLI commands (cli.py) which
already have an app context.

What this means:
- The Wednesday field confirmation pass did not find enough players
- Users will NOT receive "Picks Are Open" emails
- Deadline reminder emails will NOT be sent
- Users cannot make picks without a synced field

Recommended Actions:
1. Check if the API has field data available
2. Try running a manual field sync: flask golf sync-field
3. Check SlashGolf API status for any outages
4. If the tournament is cancelled/postponed, update the database

Admin Dashboard: {site_url}/admin

This alert will only be sent once per tournament.
